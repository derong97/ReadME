# Information on Preprocessing

This is done on the metadata obtained from: https://istd50043.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/meta_kindle_store.zip



Why Preprocessing is required:

- The original metadata lacks titles. 
- It also lacks average ratings. 

Hence, webscrapping is employed to extract title. 

For average rating, we obtained it from the Kindle reviews (MySQL).
