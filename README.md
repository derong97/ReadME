## Frontend
### Framework
To create our web application, we used ReactJS as it allows us to build large-scale applications with data that changes repeatedly over time. Apart from that, it offers the easier creation of interactive UIs, JSX support, component-based structure and much more.

### Features
ReadME has the following features/ functionalities:
* Sign up and login to our ReadME website **[Extra feature]**
  * Token-based authentication
  * Email is unique per user
  * Form validation - check for duplicate email on sign up and check for invalid email and password on login
* Navbar
  * Search for existing book by title
  * Add a new book
    * Form validation - check for repeated asin
    * Notification on successful upload
    * User can search and view the book after uploading
  * Add a new review
    * Form validation - check if user has reviewed on the book before
    * User can view the review in BY ME page after uploading
  * Logout of our ReadME website
* HOME page displays a list of 10 books that are sorted by rating from the reviews with pagination
  * Filter books by categories
  * Gets the metadata of the corresponding batch of 10 books, depending on the indicated categories as well as page number
* Display the following book details after selecting a book **[Extra feature]**
  * Book title, categories, average rating from all the reviews, price, asin, brand, sales rank
  * All the reviews of the book

    * User can view the updated changes of the review in BY ME page after submitting
  * Add a new review
    * Form validation - check if user has reviewed on the book before
    * User can view the review in BY ME page after uploading
 
### Preview
ReadME implementation and preview can be found [here](/frontend)
 
## Backend 
### Framework
To serve our web application, we used Flask as the built-in Flask web server is provided for development convenience. It is a lightweight framework that can be practiced to implement web applications(e.g. ReactJS) and backend API applications(e.g. MySQL, MongoDB). However, Flask's built-in server is not suitable for production as it doesn't scale well. Hence to run Flask in production, we deployed our your Flask application to a standalone WSGI server(Gunicorn).

### API Design Patterns
#### MongoDB
1. Book metadata collection
   
   **Schema**
   * id: ObjectId, Primary Key
   * asin: String
   * avg_rating: Double
   * categories: String[]
   * description: String
   * imUrl: String
   * price: Double
   * related: Object
     *  also_bought: String[]
     * also_viewed: String[]
     *  buy_after_viewing: String[]
   
   **Endpoints**
