## Frontend
### Framework
To create our web application, we used ReactJS as it allows us to build large-scale applications with data that changes repeatedly over time. Apart from that, it offers the easier creation of interactive UIs, JSX support, component-based structure and much more.

### Features
ReadME has the following features/ functionalities:
* Sign up and login to our ReadME website **[Extra feature]**
  + Token-based authentication
  + Email is unique per user
  + Form validation - check for repeated email upon sign up and check for invalid email and password upon login
* Navbar
  + Search for existing book by title
  + Add a new book
    + Form validation - check for repeated asin
    + Notification on successful upload
    + User can search and view the book upon upload
  + Add a new review
    + Form validation - check if user has reviewed on the book before
    + User can view the review in BY ME page upon upload
  + Logout of our ReadME website
* HOME page displays a list of 10 books that are sorted by rating from the reviews with pagination
  + Filter books by categories
  + Gets the metadata of the corresponding batch of 10 books, depending on the indicated categories as well as page number
* Display the following book details upon selection of a book **[Extra feature]**
  + Book title, categories, average rating from all the reviews, price, asin, brand, sales rank

    + User can view the updated changes of the review in BY ME page upon submit
  + Add a new review
    + Form validation - check if user has reviewed on the book before
    + User can view the review in BY ME page upon upload
 
## Backend 
### Framework
To serve our web application, we used Flask as the built-in Flask web server is provided for development convenience. It is a lightweight framework that can be practiced to implement web applications(e.g. ReactJS) and backend API applications(e.g. MySQL, MongoDB). However, Flask's built-in server is not suitable for production as it doesn't scale well. Hence to run Flask in production, we deployed our your Flask application to a standalone WSGI server(Gunicorn).

### API Design Patterns
#### MongoDB
1. Book metadata

2. Web Logs (activities from users)
   
   **Endpoints**
   
   | Endpoint                    | Method | Description                                                  |
